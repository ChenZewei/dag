=============
VIGRA Forests
=============

This repository extends the VIGRA library (http://ukoethe.github.io/vigra/) by an efficient implementation of directed acyclic graphs and forests. The API follows the LEMON Graph Library wherever possible.

Additionally, the repository includes a global refinement algorithm for random forest.
